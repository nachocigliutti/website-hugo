I'm an Economics PhD candidate at NYU, with interests in Econometrics, Labor and Macroeconomics. I'm particularily interested in the application of Machine Learning techniques in Economics. 

Before my graduate studies at NYU, I recieved BA and MA degrees in Economics (with minors in Math and Econometrics) at Universidad Torcuato di Tella, Argentina.
